Data Structures and Algorithms using Go

## Subarray Problems:
- A subarray is a contiguous part of array.
Example:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Solution: (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4), and (1,2,3,4)

# Introduction to Data Structures
- Stacks: Last in, First out
- Queues: First in, First out
- Linked Lists: A chain of nodes, efficient for inserts and deletes
- Binary Trees: A tree where each node has up to two children
- Red Black Trees: A self-balancing binary tree using colors
- Hashmaps: A data structure that maps keys to values
- Tries: A tree used for storing and searching words efficiently
- Graphs: A collection of nodes connected by edges
